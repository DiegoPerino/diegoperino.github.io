<h3>SHORT BIO</h3>
       
    <p>I work at the boundaries of research and innovation, to advance state of the art in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) areas, and ensure the successful exploitation of research outputs via technology transfer and industrial impact. </p>

    <p>I am currently the Director of <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/web/innovation/core-innovation/research">Telefonica Research</a> (Barcelona, Spain) and I lead a team of researchers in Machine Learning/Deep Learning, HCI, Security/Privacy and Networks/Systems. 
    The aim of the team is to carry research studies on several technological areas of interest to the Telefónica Group and generate impact through technology transfers. 
    Main research and innovation projects of my team at Telefonica include AI applied to networks at large (e.g., fixed, mobile, IoT, platforms), network and system design and measurements, privacy preserving and secure AI, web privacy, SDN/NFV/edge, AI for cognitive applications.</p>

    <p>From September 2009 to June 2016 I worked at Bell Labs (Paris, France) and in 2016 six months at NICTA (Sydney, Australia). During these years I worked on NFV/SDN, wearable networking, Content-Centric Networking, Content Delivery Networks, and Distributed Systems. </p>

    <p>I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Paris Diderot-Paris 7 university in 2009. My Ph.D. Thesis was a collaboration between Orange Labs and INRIA through a CIFRE contract, and focused on algorithms for peer-to-peer multimedia streaming.</p>

     <p>I received my M.S. in Networking engineering at Politecnico di Torino and Eurecom Institute of Sophia Antipolis in 2006. I also obtained a Research Master in Networking and distributed systems at Université de Nice-Sophia Antipolis.</p>
